# Phase 9 — Secure Direct Chats + Contextual @Vimla

## 1. Messaging architecture

Direct Chat is a separate conversation type from AI `Conversation` (`CHAT`) and the dedicated `@Vimla` operator thread (`OPERATOR`).

```text
Browser (IndexedDB private keys + local plaintext cache)
  -> POST/GET /v1/direct-chats*
  -> DirectChatsFacade -> @vimla/direct-chats
  -> PostgreSQL: ciphertext envelopes, public device material, membership, unread cursors
```

- Unique 1:1 pair: `pairKey = sort(userIdA, userIdB).join(":")`. Creating the same pair returns the existing row.
- Peer lookup is exact verified email. Missing/self → `not_found`.
- Server stores metadata only: sender ids, device ids, kind, timestamps, `lastMessageAt`, read cursors, consent flags.
- Message kinds: `HUMAN`, `OPERATOR_INVOKE`, `OPERATOR_RESPONSE`, `OPERATOR_ACTION`.
- Fan-out: one AEAD envelope per active member device (including the sender’s other/current devices). Incomplete fan-out is rejected.
- Unread is `lastReadMessageCreatedAt` vs later peer messages. Pagination is `createdAt|id` base64url cursors.

`@Vimla` is not a second runtime. Direct Chat invocations reuse Phase 7 `OperatorRun` with `invocationScope=DIRECT_CHAT`. Planner metering still attaches to the user’s OPERATOR `Conversation` so usage reservation stays unchanged. Direct Chat runs do **not** write plaintext `Message` rows into AI/operator threads.

## 2. E2EE architecture and threat model

Protocol: X3DH session setup + Double Ratchet, authenticated with Ed25519 over header+ciphertext+AD.

Audited primitives (`@noble/curves`, `@noble/ciphers`, `@noble/hashes`):

- X25519 DH
- Ed25519 signatures (identity + signed prekey + per-envelope sender binding)
- HKDF-SHA256
- ChaCha20-Poly1305 (IETF) with associated data

Associated data binds `conversationId`, sender user/device, recipient device, and kind. Replay uniqueness is `(senderDeviceId, recipientDeviceId, dhPublicB64, messageNumber)`.

In scope:

- Honest server cannot read Direct Chat plaintext (no private keys, no AES-at-rest of messages).
- Ciphertext tampering and sender-signature spoofing fail closed.
- Unrelated users cannot IDOR a chat (404) and cannot fetch another user’s prekeys without a shared chat.
- Feature flag fail-closed (`DIRECT_CHATS_ENABLED` default false).

Out of scope / residual:

- A compromised client or revoked device that already received envelopes can still decrypt those historical envelopes.
- The operator **command** (`OperatorRun.userText`) is plaintext on the server for execution. Chat history is not. See §4 and §9.
- Server operators can observe metadata (who talks to whom, sizes, timestamps, device public keys).

## 3. Key / device model

Each browser device generates:

- Ed25519 identity (sign)
- X25519 identity (DH)
- signed prekey + signature
- one-time prekeys

Private material never leaves IndexedDB. The API stores public keys only. Devices can be rotated (new signed prekey + OTKs) and revoked (`revokedAt`). Revoked devices cannot send or receive new envelopes.

IndexedDB keys are account-namespaced. The storage-version upgrade clears legacy unscoped records once. Explicit logout removes that account's device private material, ratchets, and plaintext cache without touching another account's records. The client revalidates a retained local device against the server before cryptographic use; an observed revocation purges the account namespace and fails closed.

One-time prekeys are claimed with a PostgreSQL row-locking atomic update. Concurrent API processes can only return the key whose `consumedAt` transition their transaction won; an exhausted device remains in the bundle response with nullable OTK fields.

Multi-device evolution is laid out: fan-out to every active device, per-device ratchets, OTK consumption. A **new** device cannot decrypt prior history (no server-side history key). That is an explicit Phase 9 limitation, not AES wrapping of old ciphertext.

## 4. @Vimla context handoff

When the user mentions `@Vimla` in a Direct Chat:

1. The client decrypts only the messages it already has locally.
2. It may attach a bounded `contextBundle` (max 16 messages, 4k chars each).
3. The server re-filters using membership + both consent flags. Peer history requires **both** `shareOwnHistoryWithVimla` (peer) and `includePeerHistoryWhenInvoking` (actor).
4. Allowed context is formatted as untrusted `self`/`peer` lines for the planner. It is not persisted, not written to Direct Chat tables, and not logged.
5. Without consent, `@Vimla` remains callable and receives the command text only.

UI distinguishes E2EE human messages, `@Vimla` invoke, context-shared vs denied, AI response, and operator action cards.

Prompt injection in chat content cannot set `userId`, expand membership, or read the peer’s Notes/Lists/Reminders. Tools still run as the authenticated actor (or a membership-resolved assignee for `tasks.create` only).

## 5. Cross-user task assignment

`tasks.create` may include `assigneeHint` (display name only). The server resolves it with `resolveDirectChatAssignee` against **current Direct Chat members**.

- empty / me → actor
- unique peer name/email local-part / 4–5 char stem → that member; `WorkspaceTask.assignedByUserId` + source `DIRECT_CHAT`
- ambiguous → clarification
- anyone else → deny

HTTP task create still has no owner/assignee fields. LLM-supplied `userId` is rejected by Zod.

## 6. Migration / API / config

Additive migration `20260911180000_add_direct_chats_e2ee`.

Config (default off):

- `DIRECT_CHATS_ENABLED=false`
- `DIRECT_CHATS_MUTATION_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=60`
- `DIRECT_CHATS_MAX_CIPHERTEXT_BYTES=65536`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_VIMLA_DIRECT_CHATS=false`

API (cookie + OriginGuard + SensitiveArea + mutation rate limit):

- `POST/GET /v1/direct-chats/devices`, rotate, revoke
- `GET /v1/direct-chats/users/:userId/prekeys` (self or shared-chat peer)
- `POST/GET /v1/direct-chats`, `GET :id`, `PATCH :id/privacy`, `POST :id/read`
- `GET/POST /v1/direct-chats/:id/messages`

Disabled → `direct_chats_disabled` (503).

## 7. Security tests

Covered: lifecycle, ciphertext-not-plaintext in PostgreSQL, tamper rejection, two-party decrypt, IDOR, sender spoof, unread/pagination, flag off, `@Vimla` general answer, context deny/allow, self task, peer task, third user denied, prompt injection does not extend permissions, responsive Direct Chat UI.

## 8. Quality gates

Lint, typecheck, unit, integration, e2e, and build for the touched packages/apps. Do not auto-merge.

## 9. Known cryptographic limitations

- New device cannot decrypt old Direct Chat history.
- Revoked/compromised device may decrypt envelopes it already obtained.
- Operator command plaintext lives on `OperatorRun.userText` for the planner/executor (not in Direct Chat storage, not in ordinary logs).
- Context bundle is ephemeral in memory during the run; a crash before planning drops it (fail closed: no persisted chat history on the server).
- No sealed-sender / metadata-hiding transport. No post-compromise recovery beyond Double Ratchet forward secrecy for later messages.
- No QR/safety-number identity verification UX in this phase (TOFU on first prekey bundle).
- Self-sent copies are kept in the client plaintext cache; the initiator ratchet cannot decrypt its own envelope.

## 10. After merge

- Enable only on explicit staging/local env (`DIRECT_CHATS_ENABLED` + `NEXT_PUBLIC_VIMLA_DIRECT_CHATS`). Keep production off until a crypto/privacy review.
- Follow-up: safety-number verification, history sharing for newly added devices (optional, user-initiated), sealed sender / extra metadata minimization, multi-device prekey refill UX, and Operator command retention policy (`userText` TTL/redaction).
- Do not start Project Chats, Brain, or Auto Router from this surface.

## 11. Browser-origin hardening

Consumer and Admin Next.js responses share a restrictive CSP, anti-framing, MIME-sniffing, referrer, and permissions policy. HSTS is emitted only for staging and production. WebAuthn remains allowed for the same origin and API connectivity is explicitly allowlisted.

The static Next.js App Router bootstrap currently requires inline script/style support, so CSP retains the explicit `unsafe-inline` residual exception. It never permits `unsafe-eval` in staging or production. Removing this exception requires a separately reviewed request-nonce architecture rather than an untested header that prevents Next.js hydration.
